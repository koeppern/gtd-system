- All source code is withnin folder `src` and subfolders in there
- Config data like settings, variables, prompts are stored in (yaml) files in folder `config`
- Never code values hard into source code file but rather load them from separate config file or even from env vars (mybe youÄll need to load .env first)
- git commit after each successfull claude code task was finished
- always create sensible tests and run them
